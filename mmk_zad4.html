        <h1>Theories of Desing</h1>
        <p>For as long as Gropius was a director of the Bauhaus, elemental shapes and primary colours continued to be a sort of ABC for designs created in the workshops. Primary colours and elemental shapes have a long history. They can be found in nineteenth century pedagogical theories formulated by the Swiss educational theorist J.H. Pestalozzi and in the work of French pointillists; they ultimately refer back to Plato's teachings in witch geometry is a reality that exists independent of a man. At the Bauhaus, these elements first appeared in 1919./1920. in Johannes Itten's courses. He had in part derived them from Kandinsky's book Uber das Geistige in der Kunst (1911.) and in part from the theories of Gillard and Grasset in Geneva ad his teacher Adolf Holzel in Stuttgart.</p>
        <h1 id="drugiP">New Structures</h1>
        <p >Mies defined the Bauhaus on the basis of architecure, while Grophius had declared architecture to be the final goal on a long path. Consequently, Mias pursued a concept of the Bauhaus that was, for the most part, contrary to Grophius's. This sort of a Bauhaus required students to be trained in the crafts, since Mies's spatial works of art involved carefully selecting, working with and combining materials. Since the workshops were no longer responsible for trainning apprentices, they could devote more attention  to questions of desing, in keeping with Miles's interests. The courses of study that were introduced in 1927. became well established and remained in the curriculum even after the Bauhaus relocated in Berlin in 1933., yet at the same tim ethey continued to change in keeping both with Mies's concepts and the possibilities that still existed in terms of financing and staffing.</p>
        <h1 id="treciP">The Nazi Campaign against the Bauhaus</h1>
        <p >Only a few months after the establishment of the Bauhaus in 1919., the devision of the Weimar Republic into a conservative German Nationalist front and Social Democratic and Communist front has reflected in the struggles surrouding the state-financed school in Weimar. Staffing decisions thet had once been purely artistic now became political. The claims staked out by political groups in the cultural arena often reflected a growing polarisation: tradition versus modernism was equal to the Right versus the Left. The Bauhaus was associated with legtist political forces. The closure of the school in Weimar was therefore inevitable when, in spring 1924., a right-wing coalition replaced the formerly leftist government of the Free State of Thuringia. The new government passed a fifty-percent cut in the budget of the despised institution as its first measure.</p>
